Leetcode-easy-problem-136
Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.
code:
class Solution {
    public int singleNumber(int[] nums) {
        int value=0;
        for(int i=0;i<nums.length;i++){
            value=value^nums[i];
        }
        return value;
    }
}

logic:
in this problem we have used xor operator to find the unique value in the array.In xor operator if different values are there we get true else we get false.the same logic is applied here.
