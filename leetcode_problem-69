sqrt(x):
Given a non-negative integer x, return the square root of x rounded down to the nearest integer. The returned integer should be non-negative as well.
In this we have used binary search approach to solve this
Java code:
class Solution {
    public int mySqrt(int x) {
       int start=1;
       int end=x;
       int res=0;
       while(start<=end){
           int mid=start+(end-start)/2;
           if(mid<=x/mid){
               start=mid+1;
               res=mid;
           }else{
               end=mid-1;
           }
       }
       return res;
    }
}
