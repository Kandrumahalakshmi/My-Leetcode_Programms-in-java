Majority Element
Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.
code:
class Solution {
    public int majorityElement(int[] nums) {
        int cand=0;
        int count=0;
        for(int i=0;i<nums.length;i++){
            if(count==0){
                cand=nums[i];
            }if(cand==nums[i]){
                count++;
            }else{
                count--;
            }
        }
        return cand;
    }
}
Logic :
Here we have used two variables count and cand to show that if there are same numbers in array count will increase or if different number comes count will decrease.
